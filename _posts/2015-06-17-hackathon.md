title: What MaptimeLA's Been Up To

Since our last post here in January, the Maptime LA group has held eleven meetups and worked on two projects and won a total of three awards. [Insert trophy emojis here]

We've been using a combination of in-person project working nights, midnight Slack conversations, Trello task-wrangling, GitHub collaborating, meeting up at people's houses and going to actual hackathon events to make it all happen.

In the open flexible/structured, learning/making, all-about-beginners space of Maptime, I wanted to note some meta-lessons we've learned on how to make projects with a lot of people work.

# Handy tools:
1. Butcher paper
2. Pens, pencils
3. Outlets
4. WiFi
5. Lots of people!
6. Online: Slack, GitHub, Trello

# Before the event
- Prepare a GitHub repository of a template with dependencies, comments, documentation and instructions.
- Download documentation in case the WiFi goes down. Dash for OSX is handy for this.
- Deploy to `gh-pages` from the start so people can keep testing it on all sorts of browsers and devices.

# Brainstorming
- Find something that interests you and you can actually use
- Keep the prize categories in mind!

# During the event
- Use a big piece of paper to brainstorm, wireframe and draw out flows. Visual is easier to talk about!
- Keep it simple: Try to focus on one single user's use case. For now.
- Make a list of the most important tasks, and expand them to other types of tasks like: copy (coming up with fun names, slogans, instructions), researching data, cleaning data, documentation, README, cleaning up the code, coming up with images for the presentation... endless!

# Keeping code clean and happy

# Working on the project
- Pair people up as much as possible. 
- Why? Pairing is important at a hackathon because it keeps people talking to each other, and you can get a gauge of where they are at.
- Pairing also makes it easier to find each other's typos.
- Ask people "Let's try.." "Want to try this?"
- Take lots of breaks :-)

# After the event
- What did you learn? Write it down, post it and share it to people.
- Make the code into something re-usable and document it.
- Comment the code to make it easier for others to replicate.

# Want to contribute?
- Make a pull request!
