Hear from the man himself, Tyler Bell gives us a tour and speaks to us about Factual.  

Factual is a location platform that enables personalized and contextually relevant mobile experiences by enriching mobile location signals with definitive global data. 

Factual’s real-time data stack builds and maintains data on a global scale, with Factual's core Global Places data covering over 65 million local businesses and points of interest in 50 countries. 

Factual’s platform also informs location with contextual demographic and commercial data, and offers cleaning and mapping services for business listings and points of interest.


## Transit:

ATTN:  Give yourself an hour to get from downtown to Century City in your car and park at the Westfield Century City Mall for $1/hr. for the first 3 hrs., carpooling highly suggested.  

-OR-

Take the 28/728 bus for the same amount of time and $1.75 each way from downtown.
